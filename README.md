# PCE & MRTS Forecasting with Fiserv FSBI Data

A research pipeline that uses the Fiserv Small Business Index (FSBI) and macroeconomic indicators to forecast U.S. Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) and Monthly Retail Trade Survey (MRTS) data. Forecast outputs drive a trading simulation layer that evaluates directional strategies on the Consumer Discretionary ETF (XLY) and FORECASTEX-style prediction markets.

## Research questions

1. Does FSBI data provide a statistically meaningful leading signal for PCE and MRTS?
2. If yes, can that signal generate excess returns in a simulated trading environment?

## Quickstart

### 1. Install dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt

### 2. Set API keys

Create a .env file in the project root (next to config.yaml):

BEA_API_KEY=your_bea_key       # https://apps.bea.gov/API/signup/
FRED_API_KEY=your_fred_key     # https://fred.stlouisfed.org/docs/api/api_key.html
USCB_API_KEY=your_census_key   # https://api.census.gov/data/key_signup.html

yfinance does not require a key.

### 3. Place external data files

Some datasets are not available via public API. Place the pre-downloaded files at:

data/raw/fsbi_raw.csv
data/raw/mrts_bbg_consensus.csv

### 4. Run the full pipeline

python main.py

This runs all stages in order: data ingestion, model experimentation, trading simulation, and plotting. Each stage can also be run independently:

python main.py --stage data        # Ingest and process raw data only
python main.py --stage experiment  # Run model grid on already-processed data
python main.py --stage trading     # Run trading simulation on experiment outputs
python main.py --stage plot        # Generate Best Model vs Baseline forecast plots

To run a specific panel:

python main.py --stage experiment --panel pce_national_mom

---

## Pipeline stages

### Stage 1 — Data

Ingestion (src/data/ingest.py) pulls from four sources:

| Source | Data | API |
|--------|------|-----|
| BEA | PCE (monthly, not seasonally adjusted) | BEA_API_KEY |
| FRED | 11 macro series (rates, labor, commodities) | FRED_API_KEY |
| USCB | MRTS retail trade sales | USCB_API_KEY |
| FSBI | Small Business Index — geography × sector × subsector | Manual CSV |
| yfinance | Daily OHLCV for XLY, SPY | None |

Raw CSVs are written to data/raw/ with a datestamp in the filename. Re-running ingestion always writes new files without deleting old ones.

Cleaning (src/data/clean.py) validates schema, aligns all non-FSBI sources to monthly frequency via forward-fill, and merges BEA + FRED + USCB into a single wide master DataFrame. FSBI is kept in long format separately because it requires per-panel geographic and sector filtering before pivoting.

Processed files written to data/processed/:
- master.csv — BEA + FRED + USCB, date-indexed
- fsbi_long.csv — FSBI in long format with Geo, Sector Name, Sub-Sector Name dimensions

### Stage 2 — Experiment

Panels (src/data/panel.py) are defined in config.yaml under data.panels. Each panel specifies a target column (pce or mrts), an optional target transform (mom, yoy, or level), and FSBI filters for geography, sector, and subsector. build_panel() joins the filtered FSBI data onto the master dataset, runs feature engineering, and returns (y, X, y_level).

Feature engineering (src/data/features.py) builds lag, rolling mean/std, and growth-rate columns for all non-target columns. Lag periods and rolling windows are set in config.yaml under features. Targets (pce, mrts) are never included as features.

Experiment grid (src/models/experiment.py) reads config.yaml under experiment to build a full cross-product of panels × model variants × parameter combinations × feature sets. Each combination is one Trial. Walk-forward (expanding window) evaluation is used throughout — no data leakage.

Outputs are written to a timestamped directory under experiments/:
- metrics.csv — one row per trial with RMSE, MAE, ME, MAPE, directional accuracy, R²
- forecasts.csv — full (date, y_true, y_pred) for every trial
- artifacts/ — per-trial JSON files with model-specific interpretability data (coefficients, feature importances, selection frequencies)
- metadata.json — run configuration summary

### Stage 3 — Trading

Built on top of experiment outputs. main.py contains a dynamic router that evaluates the strategy configured in config.yaml and deploys the appropriate backtesting engine:

Portfolio backtest uses backtrader to run monthly signal-following on standard equities (e.g., XLY). The configured strategy generates directional signals, which are executed via a long/short portfolio. Metrics: Sharpe ratio, annualised return, max drawdown, win rate.

FORECASTEX simulation (src/trading/run_event_backtest.py) models P&L on a prediction-market contract. Compares model point estimates against Bloomberg consensus strike prices, applies normal distribution math to calculate a probability edge, and outputs Pure vs. Realistic (Commission-adjusted) P&L.

Sensitivity analysis (src/trading/performance.py) measures how trading performance degrades as forecast accuracy declines by injecting Gaussian noise into y_pred at configurable σ levels and re-running the backtest for each noise level.

### Stage 4 — Visualization (Plotting)

Runs src/visualization/eval_plots.py to automatically extract the best-performing model from metrics.csv and plots its out-of-sample predictions against ground truth and a Naive baseline. Plots are saved directly into the active experiments/ run folder.

## Configuration

All experiment parameters live in config.yaml. No Python changes are needed to add models, feature sets, or panels.

### Adding a panel

data:
  panels:
    my_new_panel:
      target: "pce"                  # "pce" or "mrts"
      target_transform: "mom"        # "mom", "yoy", or null (level)
      geography: ["CA"]              # FSBI Geo values; null defaults to "US"
      sectors: ["Retail Trade"]      # substring match; null = all
      subsectors: null               # substring match; null = all

Then add the panel name to experiment.panels to include it in the next run.

### Adding a model variant

experiment:
  models:
    ml:
      variants:
        - class: RidgeForecaster
          param_grid:
            alpha: [0.001, 0.01, 0.1]
          feature_sets: [fsbi_lags, macro_lags]

param_grid is expanded into one trial per combination. Use params instead for a single fixed configuration.

### Adding a feature set

features:
  feature_sets:
    my_subset:
      - "fsbi_*_lag1"
      - "unemployment_rate_lag*"

Values are fnmatch glob patterns matched against column names after feature engineering. An empty list ([]) passes X=None to the model (pure time-series path).

### Switching the trading strategy

Strategies are loaded dynamically. Specify the .py file to load from the src/trading/strategies/ folder, and pass its required parameters.

Example A: Standard Equity Strategy (ETF Rotation)
trading:
  strategy:
    file: "krish_trade_strategy.py"
    class: "KrishTradeStrategy"
    params:
      bullish_threshold: 0.75
      bearish_threshold: -0.75
      risk_on_ticker: "XLY"
      defensive_ticker: "XLP"

Example B: Prediction Market Strategy (Binary Event Contracts)
trading:
  strategy:
    file: "mrts_event_strategy.py"
    class: "MRTSForecastMarketStrategy"
    params:
      bloomberg_csv_path: "data/raw/mrts_bbg_consensus.csv" 
      model_rmse: 0.15          
      edge_threshold: 0.02      
      contract_price: 0.50

## Models

| Class | Type | Notes |
|-------|------|-------|
| NaiveForecaster | Baseline | Last observed value |
| MeanForecaster | Baseline | Historical training mean |
| ARIMAForecaster | Time series | Pure univariate ARIMA(p,d,q) |
| ARIMAXForecaster | Time series | ARIMA with exogenous features |
| ETSForecaster | Time series | Exponential smoothing (SES / Holt / Holt-Winters) |
| ETSXForecaster | Time series | Two-stage OLS + ETS on residuals |
| ThetaForecaster | Time series | Theta model |
| OLSForecaster | ML | OLS via statsmodels; records coefficients and t-stats |
| RidgeForecaster | ML | Ridge with StandardScaler per fold |
| LassoForecaster | ML | Lasso; records feature selection frequency across folds |
| RandomForestForecaster | ML | Records mean feature importances across folds |
| XGBoostForecaster | ML | Gain-based importance; optimises MAE |
| GradientBoostingForecaster | ML | sklearn GBM |

All models implement BaseForecaster and are registered in experiment._MODEL_REGISTRY. Adding a new model requires implementing fit(), predict(), and name, then adding one line to the registry and one entry in config.yaml.

## Evaluation metrics

Walk-forward (expanding-window) evaluation is used for all models. The minimum training window before the first forecast is set by forecasting.walk_forward_min_train in config.yaml (default: 36 months).

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| MAE | Mean absolute error — primary ranking metric |
| RMSE | Root mean squared error |
| ME | Mean error (signed bias) |
| MAPE | Mean absolute percentage error |
| Dir. accuracy | Fraction of periods where sign(y_pred) == sign(y_true) |
| R² | Coefficient of determination (can be negative) |
